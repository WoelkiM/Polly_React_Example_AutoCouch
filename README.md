#Polly
Polly an example for a React app using AutoMerge.

The polling app is supposed to run on a small machine like a Raspberry Pi.
Clients can vote on polls and add new options.
The state of the poll should be converging on the client machines by using CRDTs.


## Building and Running the App

Coming soon.
